# --- Further Steps for "Deep Research" (Conceptual) ---
# To build a more comprehensive "Deep Research" system, you would:
#
#
# 2.  **Tool Use / Function Calling:**
#     - Define functions (tools) that can interact with external data sources
#       (e.g., web search APIs, academic databases, internal document stores).
#     - Configure the Gemini model with these tools.
#     - The model can then decide to call these functions to gather specific information.
#     - Example: If the research_prompt was "What are the latest developments in X according to papers published in 2024?",
#       you might have a tool `search_academic_papers(query, year)`.
#
# 3.  **Iterative Information Gathering and Synthesis:**
#     - Loop through your research plan or react to the model's function calls.
#     - Gather information from various sources (using your tools).
#     - Feed this information back to the Gemini model for processing, summarization,
#       analysis, or synthesis.
#
# 4.  **State Management:**
#     - For multi-turn interactions or complex agentic workflows, manage the state
#       (e.g., conversation history, accumulated findings).
#     - Leverage Gemini's long context window or use frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph or CrewAI
#       which can help with stateful agent execution.
#
# This snippet provides the very first step: securely interacting with the API for a complex query.
# Building the full orchestration logic for "Deep Research" is a more involved software engineering task.
